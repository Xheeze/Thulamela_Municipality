Thulamel App â€” React mockup

This small project reproduces the mobile mockup UI you attached using React + CSS (Vite).

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

1. Open PowerShell and cd to the project folder:

   cd "c:\Users\ozosi\Documents\DigiServe\thulamel-app"

2. Install dependencies:

   pnpm install

3. Run the dev server:

   pnpm dev

4. Open the URL reported by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

Notes:
- I used simple emojis and CSS shapes as placeholders for icons and the logo. Replace them with your assets (copy your mockup image into `public` or `src/assets` and update components).
- If you prefer Create React App instead of Vite, I can re-scaffold it.
